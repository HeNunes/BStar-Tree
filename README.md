# BStar-Tree
Implementation of a DBMS simulation. It uses a B*-tree structure to index data previously extracted from public sources. The project also provides a simple menu interface that allows the user to interact with the data, performing simple SQL commands.

To execute the program, download to the same directory the makefile, the header files in the "headers" folder, and the source code in the "src" folder. After that, run the following commands in your local directory:
```bash
make all
make run
```
